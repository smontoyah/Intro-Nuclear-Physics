# Nuclear Data Analysis

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook files for nuclear data analysis: **LiquidDropModel.ipynb**, **MagicNumbersGeiger.ipynb**, and **MirrorNucleiModel.ipynb**.

## LiquidDropModel.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook explores the Liquid Drop Model, a nuclear physics model used to predict the binding energy of atomic nuclei. It provides an in-depth analysis of the model and its applications in nuclear science.

## MagicNumbersGeiger.ipynb

In this Jupyter Notebook, we delve into the concept of "magic numbers" in nuclear physics and their significance. The analysis covers how these special numbers play a crucial role in the stability and structure of atomic nuclei.

## MirrorNucleiModel.ipynb

The **MirrorNucleiModel.ipynb** Notebook investigates the Mirror Nuclei Model, which is used to study the relationships and properties of nuclei with the same number of protons and different numbers of neutrons. This analysis sheds light on the behavior of mirror nuclei in the nuclear landscape.
